/**
 * Loads an HDRI/EXR sky, converts it with PMREMGenerator and uses it as the
 * scene's image-based lighting (`scene.environment`) for realistic PBR
 * reflections and soft ambient fill.
 *
 * The exhibition stays an INDOOR gallery: the outdoor sky is used only for
 * reflections/ambient (low `environmentIntensity`) and is NOT shown as the
 * background by default, so it never dominates. The dark indoor backdrop and
 * the artificial light fixtures defined in Scene.tsx remain the primary look.
 *
 * Also applies the "realistic rendering" pipeline settings: ACES Filmic tone
 * mapping, sRGB output, and soft (PCF) shadow maps. Three.js r152+ is
 * physically-based by default (no `useLegacyLights`), so lights already use
 * physical falloff.
 *
 * Memory: the source EXR DataTexture and the PMREM generator are temporary —
 * both are disposed immediately after the env map is produced; only the small
 * pre-filtered cube-UV target is kept (and disposed on unmount).
